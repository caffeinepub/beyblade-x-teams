  "summary": "The diff addresses all three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) related to fixing the maximum call stack size exceeded error. Changes include: (1) scoped query invalidation with exact:true flag in React Query hooks to prevent cascading refetches, (2) increased staleTime to 30 seconds and disabled automatic refetching on mount/focus, (3) refactored TeamDetailPage to use stable primitive dependencies in useMemo hooks instead of object references. Backend changes appear to be a migration module that is unrelated to the frontend stack overflow issue.",
