  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of all three requirements. The CreateTeamPage now properly waits for actor initialization before allowing team creation (REQ-3), displays loading states during initialization, and provides user-friendly error messages. The useCreateTeam hook verifies actor availability and checks if actor is still fetching before executing mutations (REQ-2). The team creation mutation successfully handles the complete flow including navigation to team detail page (REQ-1). All acceptance criteria appear to be met with proper error handling, loading indicators, and form disabling logic.",
