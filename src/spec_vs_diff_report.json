REQ-21 is only partially addressed: a client-side redirect script was added, but there is no evidence in the diff of deployment/DNS/hosting configuration to make https://beyhubx.com reachable as the primary domain.",

      "reason": "The diff shows a frontend client-side redirect script, but does not show any deployment/hosting configuration (e.g., custom domain binding, DNS, gateway/ingress, or platform config) that would make https://beyhubx.com/ actually serve the app. The acceptance criteria requires the app to be reachable at that URL, which cannot be verified/implemented solely by the shown HTML changes.",
