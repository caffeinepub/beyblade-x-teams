REQ-2 is partially satisfied with the hero section heading updated to 'The X' in HomePage.tsx, though the diff is truncated and doesn't show all user-facing text areas (footer, about sections, feature cards) to confirm complete removal of 'Beyblade X Teams' references.",

While the hero section h1 is updated to 'The X', the acceptance criteria requires checking footer text, about text, and feature cards for complete removal of 'Beyblade X Teams'.
