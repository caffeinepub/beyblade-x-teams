# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the application to "Bey Hub X", implement a dark/light mode theme switcher, and update the logo with the uploaded Beyblade X image.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-facing references from "The X" to "Bey Hub X" in the frontend (title, header, homepage, meta tags)
- Implement a theme switcher component that allows users to toggle between dark mode and light mode
- Persist the selected theme in localStorage so it remains active across sessions
- Replace the current logo with the uploaded Beyblade X image in the header and other branding locations

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the rebranded "Bey Hub X" name throughout the site, can switch between dark and light themes that persist across visits, and will see the new Beyblade X logo in the header.
