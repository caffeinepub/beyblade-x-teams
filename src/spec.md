# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add profile picture display on profile pages and implement a team battle request system where team leaders can challenge other teams to Beyblade battles on specific dates.

**Planned changes:**
- Display user profile pictures on profile pages when available
- Add backend data model for battle requests between teams
- Create backend endpoints for team leaders to send, accept, and reject battle requests
- Add frontend UI for team leaders to request battles with other teams and select a proposed date
- Add frontend UI for team leaders to view and respond to incoming battle requests
- Display scheduled battles on team detail pages showing opponent and agreed date

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see their profile pictures on their profile pages. Team leaders can challenge other teams to battles by proposing a date, accept or reject incoming battle requests, and view scheduled battles on team pages.
