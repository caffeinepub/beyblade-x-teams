# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the text-based header logo with the custom Beyblade X image.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the text "Bey Hub X" in the AppHeader component with the custom Beyblade X image
- Ensure the logo image is properly sized, positioned, and maintains aspect ratio
- Make the logo clickable to navigate to the home page
- Ensure responsive display on both mobile and desktop viewports

**User-visible outcome:** The website header displays a custom Beyblade X logo image instead of text, matching the branding style similar to how major websites display their logos.
