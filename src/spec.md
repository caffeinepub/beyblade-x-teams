# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the website from "Beyblade X Teams" to "The X".

**Planned changes:**
- Update the website title in frontend/index.html to "The X"
- Update all Open Graph meta tags to reference "The X"
- Replace all user-facing text references from "Beyblade X Teams" to "The X" throughout the application

**User-visible outcome:** The website now displays "The X" as its name in the browser tab, page content, and all metadata, with no remaining references to "Beyblade X Teams".
